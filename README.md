# DOODOO - 3D FPS Renderer

A Doom-inspired 3D renderer built from scratch in C using only SDL.

## Overview

This project implements a raycasting engine that creates nostalgic corridor-style 3D graphics reminiscent of classic 90s FPS games. Built with minimal dependencies, it focuses on fundamental 3D rendering techniques.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Pure C
- **Dependencies**: SDL only
- **Rendering Technique**: DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm for raycasting
- **Architecture**: "Bare-bones" approach with minimal external libraries

## Project Goals

This passion project was created to:
- Deepen understanding of low-level programming concepts
- Explore 3D rendering fundamentals from first principles
- Create a functional retro-style 3D renderer with minimal dependencies
